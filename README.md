# FlipTextDemoApp
Android Flip Text Demo App

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Flip Text Demo' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a title ('Flip Text Demo App')on the top. Then in the middle of the app are the apps components. 
On the top is a PlainText (editText) line with a hint labeled 'Input Text'. Then right below is a green button labeled 'CLICK TO FLIP'.
Followed right below by a PlainText (editText) line with a lint labeled 'Output Text'.

As the user clicks the top 'Input Text' line a typewriter pops up and they enter the various text they wish to use. 
Then when they are done they click the Green Button in the middle labeled 'CLICK TO FLIP' to flip the contents of the top line.
On the bottom 'Output Text' line the text that was typed in is now shown in a flipped manor. 
If the user wants to try it again, all they need to do is select the top 'Input Text' line again and delete the typed in contents 
to type something else. The user can enter the following string characters in to flip them below: 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`~!@#$%^&*()[]{}|:;'<>,.?
